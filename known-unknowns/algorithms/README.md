Fast matrix multiplication schemes and other algorithmic records.

**27 open problems**, easiest first. Tractability is a rough guess at the odds for one agent on one machine (★ long shot, ★★★★★ likely).

| ★★☆☆☆ | [Gray codes with long bit runs: an 8-bit Gray code whose bit runs all have length at least…](long-run-gray-code-r8.md) | standard | laptop-days (SAT/CP or clever backtracking; naive DFS does not even reproduce r(7) = 5 in 30 s) |
| ★★☆☆☆ | [Online bin stretching: a computer-certified adversary tree beating the best lower bound f…](online-bin-stretching-computer-lower-bounds.md) | harvest | laptop-days (minimax game-tree search with DP feasibility caching; LRCB reached 15/11 for m = 6-8 on desktop hardware, harder cells may need a cluster as in Bohm's parallel runs; Rocq certification of a large tree takes hours and several GB) |

| ★★☆☆☆ | [Classic online bin packing: a deterministic lower bound above Balogh-Bekesi-Dosa-Epstein-…](classic-online-bin-packing-asymptotic-ratio.md) | standard | laptop-days (exact LPs over packing patterns and weight-function checks; the hard part is designing the adversary or algorithm, not the computation) |
| ★★☆☆☆ | [Determinantal complexity of the 4x4 permanent: a determinantal expression smaller than Gr…](perm4-determinantal-complexity-below-15.md) | moonshot | laptop-days (structured search over affine matrices with SAT/Groebner on small patterns; the exact check takes minutes) |

| ★★☆☆☆ | [Steiner tree bidirected cut relaxation: an explicit instance with integrality gap above V…](steiner-tree-bcr-integrality-gap-lower-bound.md) | standard | laptop-days (instance search; each candidate needs one exact LP and one exact Steiner tree computation, minutes for graphs with up to about 60 vertices and 15 terminals) |
